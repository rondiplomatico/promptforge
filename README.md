# PromptForge

A self-improvement toolkit for Claude Code. Captures user interactions (prompts, clarification answers, tool denials, turn metadata) as structured JSONL, then analyzes friction patterns and suggests improvements to your project configuration and BMAD setup.

## Install / Uninstall

**Prerequisites**: `jq` (required), `python3` (optional, for analysis scripts)

```bash
./install.sh    # interactive: choose target, link/copy mode, optional history import
./uninstall.sh  # interactive: manifest-based removal with user-file detection
```

Both scripts prompt for the target: global (`~/.claude/`), a project path, or the current directory. Install supports **symlink** mode (auto-updates on `git pull`) or **copy** mode. Run install multiple times for different targets.

The installer writes an `install.manifest` and a `setup.yaml` (scope, mode, source, manifest metadata) used by commands and the uninstaller. Uninstall also checks for user-added files and optionally preserves log data.

**Updating** (symlink mode): `git pull` in the promptforge repo. Copy mode: re-run `./install.sh`.

## Scope Selection

For **global installs**, each promptforge command asks whether to run in **project** or **global** scope:

- **Project scope**: analyzes only log entries from the current project and targets project-local config (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, project memory)
- **Global scope**: analyzes all log entries across projects and targets global config (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/memory/`)

For **project-local installs**, project scope is used automatically — no question is asked.

The scope is detected from `setup.yaml` (written at install time), so no Bash/readlink tool use is needed.

## How to Use

### `/promptforge:analyze-usage` — Usage Report

Generates a report on interaction volume, activity distribution, token usage, time patterns, and project breakdown. Scope-aware: in project scope, only entries from the current project are included.

```bash
# Or run the script directly with options:
python3 scripts/analyze-usage.py --since 2026-01-01 --format markdown --output report.md
python3 scripts/analyze-usage.py --project-filter /path/to/project --format markdown
```

### `/promptforge:analyze-corrections` — Friction Analysis

Detects friction patterns: repeated clarifications, tool denials, negation language, contradictions, and correction chains. Writes a Friction Report to the scope-appropriate location (project: `<project>/.claude/promptforge/friction-report.md`, global: `~/.claude/promptforge/friction-report.md`).

Uses `skills/analyze-corrections/extract_friction.py` to pre-aggregate signals, reducing context load for analysis.

### `/promptforge:improve-project` — Project Config Improvements

Reads the Friction Report (from analyze-corrections) and cross-references it with your current config. In project scope, targets `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, and project memory. In global scope, targets `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, and `~/.claude/memory/`.

**Requires**: Run `analyze-corrections` first to generate the friction report.

### `/promptforge:improve-bmad` — BMAD Config Improvements

Filters friction patterns for BMAD-related items and cross-references with your `.bmad-core/` agents, tasks, and checklists. Suggests defaults, template additions, and checklist adjustments. Only works in project scope (BMAD is project-local).

**Requires**: Run `analyze-corrections` first. Only useful if you use BMAD.

### Recommended Workflow

1. Use Claude Code normally to accumulate logs
2. `/promptforge:analyze-usage` — understand your patterns
3. `/promptforge:analyze-corrections` — generate friction report
4. `/promptforge:improve-project` and/or `/promptforge:improve-bmad` — get actionable suggestions

### Utility Scripts

```bash
# Backfill from existing Claude Code sessions
python3 scripts/extract-sessions.py --include-old-logs
python3 scripts/extract-sessions.py --since 2026-01-01 --project myproject

# Validate log files against schema
python3 scripts/validate-logs.py
```
